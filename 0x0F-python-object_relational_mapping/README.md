# *Python - Object-relational mapping*

## Overview
This project focuses on implementing Object-relational mapping (ORM) in Python \
to interact with a MySQL database. ORM allows us to map Python classes to \
database tables, making it easier to work with databases using object-oriented \
programming principles.

## Learning Objectives

   	    -Learn how to connect to a MySQL database from a Python script
	    -Understand how to SELECT rows in a MySQL table from a Python script
	    -Master the skill of INSERTing rows in a MySQL table from a Python script
	    -Gain knowledge about ORM and its significance in database interaction
	    -Learn how to map a Python Class to a MySQL table
	    -Understand the importance of creating a Python Virtual Environment for project isolation
